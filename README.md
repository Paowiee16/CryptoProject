# FauxCoin Exchange
Developed a personal project website using React and Tailwind CSS that simulates a cryptocurrency exchange called FauxCoin Exchange. The website allows users to view real-time cryptocurrency prices and practice trading in a simulated environment. This project allowed me to strengthen my React and CSS skills.
